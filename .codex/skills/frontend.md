# Codex Skill: Frontend (Astro)

Goal: keep the site minimal, fast, and content-first.

Rules:
- Prefer Astro pages + content collections.
- Avoid heavy client JS; default to server/static rendering.
- Keep CSS simple, typography-first, minimal components.

Commands:
- cd site
- npm install
- npm run dev
- npm run build

Definition of done:
- `npm run build` passes.
- Blog list + post pages render from markdown.
- RSS works.
