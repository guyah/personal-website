Generative engineering is not a tool swap. It is a workflow shift. The biggest change is how we scope work: smaller slices, more evaluation, tighter feedback.

What I recommend to teams:

- Start with a single workflow and automate the boring 20 percent.
- Add a lightweight eval suite before you scale.
- Treat prompts and tools as code, with versioning and reviews.

The cultural shift is equally important. People need permission to experiment, and they need a path to production that does not feel scary.

If you do this right, you end up with a team that ships faster and a system that is more testable. That is a rare combination.
