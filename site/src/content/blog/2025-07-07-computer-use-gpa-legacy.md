There is a class of enterprise work that lives in decades-old systems. The data is locked behind brittle UIs, and the API story is “maybe next year.”

A UI-automation agent is often the most practical bridge:

- It preserves the existing workflow.
- It avoids risky data migrations.
- It can be incrementally introduced with human oversight.

The trick is to treat it like a product, not a script. It needs monitoring, replay, and a clear failure mode when the UI changes.

This is also a place where voice agents shine. A worker can say “pull the report, normalize dates, and stage it for review,” and the agent can do the tedious clicks.

Legacy systems are not going away. The right agent strategy is to meet them where they are.
