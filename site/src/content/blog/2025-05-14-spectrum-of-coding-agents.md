I think about coding agents on a spectrum rather than a binary. At one end is autocomplete. At the other is full task ownership. Most teams live in the middle.

A simple spectrum I use:

- Assist: completes code, no context management.
- Collaborate: proposes changes, expects review.
- Execute: handles tasks end-to-end with checkpoints.

The trick is aligning the agent level with team maturity. Jumping too far too fast creates trust gaps.

A clear spectrum helps with adoption. It lets teams say, “We are here now, we want to get there next,” and measure progress without hype.
