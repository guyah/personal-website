When people ask *“is the lottery rigged?”* they usually mean one of two things:

1. **Some numbers appear too often** (frequency intuition).
2. **The process has a systematic bias** (a real mechanism).

This post is a **reproducible** template that runs on **real draw history**.

Here I use **Lebanese Loto (6/42)**, using publicly available draw pages.

All plots in this post are generated by:

- `site/analysis/generate_all.py` (task: `lottery_fairness`)

And the dataset is fetched by:

- `site/analysis/fetch_lebanon_loto.py`

## Step 1 — frequency deviations (real draws)

If the machine is fair, each ball should appear about equally often across many draws.

The plot below shows, for each ball 1..42:

- **observed count − expected count**

Interpretation:

- Positive bars = “hotter than expected”
- Negative bars = “colder than expected”
- With finite data, you should expect visible spread.

## Step 2 — a simple global test (chi-square) on real data

A classic global test for categorical frequencies is the **chi-square goodness-of-fit test**.

- Null hypothesis: each ball is equally likely (in expectation)
- Test statistic: how far observed counts deviate from expected counts

Important caveat:

- A low p-value can indicate bias **or** data issues (scraping errors, missing draws, rule changes, etc.). It’s a flag, not a verdict.

## Data source note

The draw pages are scraped from `lebanon-lotto.com`.

They explicitly state they are **not an official website**. Treat this as *best-effort public data* unless you cross-check with the official operator.

## Reproduce

From repo root:

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r site/analysis/requirements.txt
python site/analysis/generate_all.py
```
