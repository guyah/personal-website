## TL;DR

- Nothing looks statistically weird in the last **200 Lebanese Loto** draws (**p≈0.50**).
- “Hot” and “cold” numbers appear automatically in finite samples — that’s not bias.
- To detect small bias, you need more draws *and* a plausible mechanism.

## Numbers (from the dataset)

| Item | Value |
|---|---|
| Dataset | Lebanese Loto (6/42), last 200 draws |
| Global test | chi²(df=41)=40.26 → p=0.503 |
| Hottest (Δ count) | 35 (+13.4), 5 (+8.4), 20 (+7.4) |
| Coldest (Δ count) | 9 (−12.6), 15 (−8.6), 27 (−7.6) |

When people ask *“is the lottery rigged?”* they usually mean one of two things:

1. **Some numbers appear too often** (frequency intuition)
2. **The process has a systematic bias** (a real mechanism)

This post is a reproducible template that runs on **real draw history**.

Here I use **Lebanese Loto (6/42)**, using publicly available draw pages.

Plots are generated by:

- `site/analysis/generate_all.py` (task: `lottery_fairness`)

Data is fetched by:

- `site/analysis/fetch_lebanon_loto.py`

## Step 1 — frequency deviations (real draws)

If the machine is fair, each ball should appear about equally often across many draws.

The plot below shows, for each ball 1..42:

- **observed count − expected count**

## Step 2 — a global test (chi-square) on real data

A chi-square goodness-of-fit test answers a narrow question:

> “Are the overall frequency deviations surprising under a uniform model?”

## What this actually means

- **p≈0.50 is boring (good):** the aggregate counts look like chance.
- The biggest “hot” ball (35) is **not** evidence — randomness produces leaders/laggards at small n.
- The only useful definition of “suspicious” is: statistically unlikely **and** mechanistically plausible.

## If you want to catch real bias

You need:

1) more draws, 2) stable rules, and 3) a plausible mechanism (machine, ball batches, venue changes).

Otherwise you’re just pattern-matching noise.

## Data source note

The draw pages are scraped from `lebanon-lotto.com`.

They explicitly state they are **not an official website**. Treat this as best-effort public data unless you cross-check with the official operator.

## Reproduce

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
