When people ask *“is the lottery rigged?”* they usually mean one of two things:

1. **Some numbers appear too often** (frequency intuition)
2. **The process has a systematic bias** (a real mechanism)

This post is a reproducible template that runs on **real draw history**.

Here I use **Lebanese Loto (6/42)**, using publicly available draw pages.

Plots are generated by:

- `site/analysis/generate_all.py` (task: `lottery_fairness`)

Data is fetched by:

- `site/analysis/fetch_lebanon_loto.py`

## Step 1 — frequency deviations (real draws)

If the machine is fair, each ball should appear about equally often across many draws.

The plot below shows, for each ball 1..42:

- **observed count − expected count**

## Step 2 — a global test (chi-square) on real data

A chi-square goodness-of-fit test answers a narrow question:

> “Are the overall frequency deviations surprising under a uniform model?”

<Insights
	title="What this actually means"
	items={[
		"p≈0.50 is boring (good): the aggregate counts look like chance.",
		"The biggest ‘hot’ ball (35) is not evidence—randomness produces leaders and laggards automatically at small n.",
		"The only useful definition of ‘suspicious’ is: statistically unlikely *and* mechanistically plausible.",
	]}

<Callout
	title="If you want to catch real bias"
	body="You need (1) more draws, (2) stable rules, and (3) a plausible mechanism (machine, ball batches, venue changes). Otherwise you’re just pattern-matching noise."

## Data source note

The draw pages are scraped from `lebanon-lotto.com`.

They explicitly state they are **not an official website**. Treat this as best-effort public data unless you cross-check with the official operator.

## Reproduce

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
