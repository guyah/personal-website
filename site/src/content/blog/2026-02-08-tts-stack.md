## TL;DR

- TTS fails more often in **text normalization + pronunciation** than in the vocoder.
- Latency consistency matters more than peak quality for voice UX.
- Ship with controls (rate/emphasis) + monitoring (dropouts, clipping, pacing).

Text-to-speech looks solved—until you try to ship it.

Modern neural TTS sounds great in demos, but production quality depends on a whole stack:

1. **Text normalization** (numbers, abbreviations, dates)
2. **Pronunciation / phonemization**
3. **Prosody** (durations, stress, intonation)
4. **Acoustic modeling** (text/phonemes → mel or latent)
5. **Vocoder** (mel/latent → waveform)
6. **Streaming + buffering**

Plots generated by:

- `site/analysis/generate_all.py` (task: `tts_durations`)

## A tiny real measurement (duration)

This is a small real sample of TTS outputs (just to force the discipline of measuring):

| Item | Value |
|---|---|
| Samples | 4 |
| Durations (s) | 1.7, 5.2, 8.3, 8.6 |
| Why it matters | duration controls pacing + turn-taking |

## Where TTS breaks (in real products)

### 1) Text normalization failures

- “1/2” → “one slash two” vs “one half”
- “€12.50” → wrong currency or decimal reading
- times and dates

If you let the model guess, you’ll ship embarrassing mistakes.

### 2) Pronunciation failures

Names, acronyms, and domain terms need:

- custom lexicons
- grapheme-to-phoneme overrides
- user-specific pronunciation adaptation (if allowed)

### 3) Latency and streaming failures

Voice UX is sensitive to:

- time-to-first-audio
- chunking artifacts
- buffering glitches

A strong TTS model that’s slow will feel worse than a slightly weaker model that’s fast and consistent.

## Minimal production checklist

- Deterministic text normalization (don’t let the model improvise dates/units).
- Configurable pronunciation dictionary for names + domain terms.
- Prosody controls (rate/emphasis) exposed as product features.
- Streaming path (first chunk fast) + monitoring for audio glitches.

## Reproduce

```bash
python site/analysis/generate_all.py
```
