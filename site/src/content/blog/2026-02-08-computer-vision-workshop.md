## TL;DR

I built the ComputerVisionWorkshop repo as a practical, hands-on path into computer vision, focused on doing over reading.

## Context

Computer vision can feel like a wall of math, models, and scattered tutorials. I wanted a single place that reduces the setup friction and gives learners a clear path from basics to working results.

## What I built

A GitHub repo that anchors a workshop. The goal is to keep the flow tight: short explanations, runnable examples, and exercises that build on each other.

## Key decisions

- Keep the scope narrow so the workshop can be finished in one focused sprint
- Favor practical building blocks over theory first
- Make the sequence linear so people can follow along without context switching
- Use small, visible wins to keep momentum high

## Lessons

- People learn faster when the first working result lands early
- Consistent structure beats fancy content
- A good workshop is a product, not a pile of notes
