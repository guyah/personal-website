The jump from “autocomplete” to “collaborator” is not just model quality. It is the workflow around it: context curation, task framing, and feedback loops.

A 2.0-style coding agent earns trust by being predictable:

- It states assumptions before making changes.
- It narrows scope when the request is too big.
- It leaves breadcrumbs (notes, test commands) after edits.

I also care about safety rails that are not annoying. The best guardrails are social: the agent writes like a teammate who expects review, not a black box that expects applause.

In practice, this means more time on:

- Clean diffs and small commits.
- Thin slices of functionality.
- Honest uncertainty about hidden dependencies.

The surprising part is that “faster” is not the primary benefit. The real win is lower cognitive load: I can focus on product decisions while the agent handles the mechanical work.
