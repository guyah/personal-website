I often bucket coding agents into two styles. The first is a fast operator: minimal back-and-forth, aggressive changes. The second is a careful collaborator: slower but transparent.

The choice depends on context:

- Prototyping favors speed and broad changes.
- Production favors transparency and narrow diffs.

What I want in a platform is the ability to switch modes. Sometimes I want the bulldozer. Sometimes I want the scalpel.

A good system exposes that as a setting, not a hidden behavior. It should be obvious which mode I am in and why.
