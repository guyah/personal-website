Small systems are easier to keep honest. You can see everything, and you can move faster.

For personal sites and internal tools, I optimize for a handful of traits:

- **Clarity over features.** Each element should earn its place.
- **Durability.** Fewer moving parts means fewer breakages.
- **Speed.** The page should feel instant, even on a slow connection.

The goal is not austerity. It is focus.
