A personal agent is not just an assistant. It is a memory layer. It knows how I work, what I ignore, and how I make decisions.

The fastest way to make a personal agent useful is to define boundaries:

- What it can do without asking.
- What it must ask every time.
- What it should never do.

If you get those boundaries right, the rest can improve iteratively. If you get them wrong, trust evaporates.

I also think personal agents need a personality that is consistent but quiet. A subtle, predictable tone beats a performative one.

The metric I watch is “days saved.” Not just time saved today, but friction reduced across a month of real work.
