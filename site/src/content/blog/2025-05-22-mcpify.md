When tools are inconsistent, agents become fragile. Every tool needs a new prompt, a new set of edge cases, and a new retry story.

I like the idea of “MCPify” as a verb: take a useful tool and wrap it in a consistent, typed interface with predictable errors.

The immediate benefits:

- Cleaner agent instructions.
- Better test coverage for tools.
- Easier routing and orchestration.

The longer-term benefit is portability. If a tool speaks the same protocol, I can swap providers without retraining the agent.

This is boring work, and that is exactly why it matters.
