The fastest way to scale an agent program is to recycle workflows. If something worked once, it should become a template.

I look for these signals:

- The task repeats monthly or quarterly.
- The input format is stable.
- The output has a clear evaluation step.

When those hold, I package the workflow: a prompt, a tool set, and a checklist for review. That makes it reusable by other teams.

This is where agent work becomes compounding. One good workflow can save hours every month.
