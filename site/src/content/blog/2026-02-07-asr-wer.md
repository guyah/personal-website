WER (Word Error Rate) is the default ASR metric.

It’s also one of the easiest metrics to misunderstand.

The mistake is treating “WER = 8%” as if it implies a smooth user experience.

In practice, ASR failures are often dominated by:

- **domain shift** (names, jargon, accents, products)
- **noise and microphone differences**
- **a long tail of catastrophic utterances**

This post shows two plots I like for making that visible.

Plots generated by:

- `site/analysis/generate_all.py` (task: `asr_wer`)

## WER vs noise (SNR)

A curve over signal-to-noise ratio immediately answers:

- how robust are we to noise?
- is there an irreducible floor?

Synthetic example (shape is the point):

Domain shift often shows up as:

- worse WER at every SNR
- and/or a worse *floor* even at high SNR

Because it’s not noise; it’s vocabulary and priors.

## Utterance-level WER distribution (the long tail)

Users don’t experience average WER.

They experience **per-utterance** outcomes:

- most utterances are fine
- a few are disasters

Synthetic heavy-tailed utterance WER:

This is why voice products can feel broken even with decent average WER.

### Practical implication

You need tooling for tail cases:

- fallback confirmations
- robust slot filling
- spelling / name capture flows
- retry prompts that don’t feel accusatory

## Reproduce

```bash
python site/analysis/generate_all.py
```

### TODO

- Add stratified WER by intent type (commands vs dictation).
- Add confidence calibration plots (reliability diagram for ASR confidence).
