Static UI is a poor match for dynamic agent work. If the agent is changing its plan, the interface should adapt too.

Generative UI means:

- The interface responds to the task, not the other way around.
- The agent can surface controls exactly when needed.
- The output is structured enough to be editable.

This is not a call to generate everything. It is a call to let the agent drive the layout where it makes sense, and keep human control where it matters.

The “beyond” part is collaboration. If multiple people are involved, the UI should show who did what and why. That is the difference between a demo and a real workflow.
