I sometimes run a “dance-off” between coding agents: give them the same small task, the same repo, and a time limit. The goal is not to crown a winner. It is to learn how they fail.

My rules:

- The task must be real and annoying, not trivial.
- I watch for clarification questions and test usage.
- I score for reviewability, not just correctness.

The results are often surprising. One agent might be slow but safe, another fast but messy. That gives me a real basis for choosing the right tool for the job.

Benchmarks matter, but local reality matters more.
