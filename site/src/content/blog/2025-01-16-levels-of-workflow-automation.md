Automation is not binary. I use levels so teams can talk about what is actually shipped.

My rough levels:

- Level 1: suggest (the agent proposes, human executes).
- Level 2: assist (the agent executes with confirmation).
- Level 3: operate (the agent executes with audit).

The value of levels is expectation management. Users are calm when they know how much autonomy the system has.

This also helps with rollout. You can ship level 1 safely, then move up as trust grows.
