“Dark mode” is a useful metaphor: an agent can do a lot in the background, but too much invisibility creates risk. Users need to know what changed and why.

I look for three design signals:

- A clear activity log with timestamps.
- Undo as a first-class action.
- Notifications that are quiet but reliable.

If the agent is operating without visibility, it is not helping. It is just shifting risk onto the user.

Good automation feels like a well-lit room. You can see what is happening, and you can step in at any time.
