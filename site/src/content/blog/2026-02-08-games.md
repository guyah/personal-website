I started shipping software by building small mobile games.

Games are brutally honest products: players churn the moment friction shows up. That era shaped how I build today (tight loops, measurable behavior, and an obsession with latency).

I’m most proud of **Shooton**, **UpJump**, and **Deezy**.

## Shooton (favorite)

- TouchArcade: https://toucharcade.com/games/shooton

**What it is:** tap-to-shoot arcade. Miss once and it’s game over.

**What I learned:** one mechanic can carry the whole game if the feedback is crisp.

## UpJump (favorite)

- TouchArcade: https://toucharcade.com/games/upjump

**What it is:** endless vertical dodger — left/right jumps through moving obstacles.

**What I learned:** difficulty curves are a product surface. You can *feel* when the ramp is unfair.

## Deezy (favorite)

<img src="/assets/games/deezy/shot1.jpg" width="260" /> <img src="/assets/games/deezy/shot2.jpg" width="260" />

- TouchArcade: https://toucharcade.com/games/deezy

**What it is:** color-match reflex game: rotate and match; streaks increase complexity.

**What I learned:** “simple rules” isn’t the same as “easy.” The best casual games stay legible while getting hard.

## What’s next

I’ll turn this into a proper “Games” section with tighter write-ups (what the core loop was, what worked, what didn’t) and any store links that still exist.
