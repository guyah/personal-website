Before I worked on voice agents and production AI systems, I spent years shipping small mobile games.

I’m biased toward shipping because games force you to be honest:

- If the onboarding is confusing, players quit.
- If performance stutters, it *feels* broken.
- If the loop isn’t fun, no amount of polish saves it.

## What I built

I shipped **10+ original iOS games** (mostly solo) and learned the full stack of “small product” work:

- game feel (input latency, animation timing, feedback)
- progression loops and retention
- lightweight monetization (ads, basic IAP)
- analytics and iteration

## Lessons that still apply in AI products

### 1) Latency is a feature
A 200ms improvement is sometimes more valuable than a new capability. Speed changes user trust.

### 2) Make the next step obvious
Good products don’t require instructions. The UI should suggest what to do next.

### 3) Ship tiny, iterate fast
A small, measurable release beats a big rewrite. This is even more true with agents.

### 4) Instrument everything (but keep it simple)
Track the few metrics that actually drive decisions, then iterate.

## What I’d like to add here

Over time, I’ll expand this post with the **actual titles**, screenshots, and what I learned from each one.
