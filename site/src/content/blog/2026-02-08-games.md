I started shipping software by building small mobile games.

Games are brutally honest products: players churn the moment friction shows up. That era shaped how I build today (tight loops, measurable behavior, and an obsession with latency).

Below is a lightweight archive. I’m most proud of **Shooton**, **UpJump**, and **Deezy**.

## Shooton

- TouchArcade: https://toucharcade.com/games/shooton

**What it is:** tap-to-shoot arcade. Miss once and it’s game over.

**What I learned:** a single mechanic can carry the whole game if the feedback is crisp.

## UpJump

- TouchArcade: https://toucharcade.com/games/upjump

**What it is:** endless vertical dodger — left/right jumps through moving obstacles.

**What I learned:** difficulty curves are a product surface. You can *feel* when the ramp is unfair.

## Deezy

- TouchArcade: https://toucharcade.com/games/deezy

<img src="/assets/games/deezy/shot1.jpg" width="240" /> <img src="/assets/games/deezy/shot2.jpg" width="240" />

**What it is:** color-match reflex game: rotate and match; streaks increase complexity.

**What I learned:** “simple rules” isn’t the same as “easy.” The best casual games stay legible while getting hard.

## Squish em

- TouchArcade: https://toucharcade.com/games/squish-em

<img src="/assets/games/squish-em/shot1.jpg" width="240" /> <img src="/assets/games/squish-em/shot2.jpg" width="240" />

**What it is:** dodge enemies, break/push walls, and squish them.

**What I learned:** readable motion + strong hit effects do most of the work.

## What’s next

I’m expanding this into a proper “Games” page with:

- a full list of everything I shipped
- links to any store pages that still exist
- short design notes for each game

If you played any of these years ago and still remember it — I’d love to hear about it.
