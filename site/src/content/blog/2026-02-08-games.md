I didn’t start coding because I had a plan.

I started because I had curiosity, a phone, and the kind of stubborn optimism you get right after graduating from high school.

Back then, I knew *nothing* about programming. No CS background, no “I’ve been building since I was 12.” Just a simple idea: learn by doing, and ship something real.

## The first teacher: a video course

My entry point was an early version of Swift — the kind that changed fast and broke your code for fun.

I learned it from **Simon Allardice** on **Lynda** (before “learn Swift” had a million YouTube playlists). I remember following along, pausing constantly, replaying the same sections, and feeling that very specific moment when a concept clicks and you suddenly see the shape of the whole thing.

That course didn’t just teach syntax. It gave me permission to build.

## The era: Flappy Bird, and the hyper‑casual mindset

This was around the time **Flappy Bird** proved something important:

- you don’t need a giant team to make something people download
- you need a loop that’s *instantly understood*
- and you need the game to *feel* right

So I made hyper‑casual games. Lots of them.

Small scope. One mechanic. Tight feedback. Ship. Repeat.

## Shipping as a learning strategy

I ended up designing, developing, and publishing **10+ hyper‑casual mobile games**.

Some were better than others. None were perfect. But every release taught me the same lesson: the fastest way to learn is to put your work in front of real users.

Bugs, device quirks, performance, UI friction — reality gives you feedback that tutorials never will.

## Monetization: AdMob, banners, interstitials… and a letter in the mail

At some point I wanted to do the “real” thing: ship and monetize.

So I set up **AdMob** and started using:

- **banner ads** (the classic always‑there revenue drip)
- **interstitial ads** (the bigger hit between attempts)

But the part I still remember most isn’t the SDK integration.

It’s the logistics.

To fully activate AdMob at the time, I had to **wait for a physical letter** with a code — mailed **all the way to Lebanon**.

There’s something funny about that now:

I was building digital products for the world… and progress depended on a piece of paper crossing borders.

When that letter finally arrived, it felt like a small rite of passage. Like: okay, this is real now.

## Featured games

I’m most proud of **Shooton**, **UpJump**, and **Deezy**.

## Why this still matters to me

That period trained my instincts:

- ship small things quickly
- respect latency and “feel”
- learn from real users, not theory

It’s the same mindset I bring today when I build AI products — just with different tools.
