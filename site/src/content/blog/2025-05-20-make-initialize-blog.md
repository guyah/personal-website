I keep a tiny make target that sets up a new post: filename, frontmatter, and a draft structure. It sounds trivial, but it removes friction.

My template includes:

- A working title and one-line summary.
- A placeholder for the “why now” note.
- A short list of takeaways.

The goal is to lower the activation energy. If writing feels heavy, it will not happen. If the first steps are automatic, I can focus on the content.

This same pattern applies to agent work. Tiny, repeatable bootstraps are underrated.
