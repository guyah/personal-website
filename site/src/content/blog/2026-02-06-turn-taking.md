Turn-taking is the hidden UX of voicebots.

Most teams talk about *ASR accuracy* and *LLM quality*, but the user experience often hinges on a simpler classifier:

> **Voice Activity Detection (VAD)**

VAD decides:

- when the user started speaking
- when they stopped speaking
- whether a noise burst is “speech”

This post treats VAD like what it is: a thresholded score with a trade-off curve.

Plots generated by:

- `site/analysis/generate_all.py` (task: `turn_taking_vad`)

## ROC thinking for VAD

Given a VAD score (0..1), choose a threshold t:

- score ≥ t ⇒ speech
- score < t ⇒ non-speech

As you raise the threshold:

- fewer false triggers (good)
- more missed speech (bad)

The ROC-like trade-off curve (synthetic):

This is not an academic chart. It’s a product dial.

- In a quiet environment, you can tolerate a lower threshold.
- In a noisy environment, you may need a higher threshold + better denoising.

## Look at the score distributions

The ROC curve is a summary; distributions explain *why*.

Speech frame scores:

Non-speech frame scores:

If these overlap heavily, no threshold will save you.

That’s when you need:

- better front-end denoising
- better microphone / gain
- a stronger VAD model
- task-specific tuning (push-to-talk vs open mic)

## Mistakes have asymmetric costs

Two mistakes:

1. **False trigger**: you start listening when nobody spoke.
2. **Missed speech**: you cut off the user or never detect speech.

In most voice UX, missed speech is more damaging. Users adapt by repeating themselves, raising their voice, or leaving.

So the “optimal” threshold depends on *your cost function*.

## Reproduce

```bash
python site/analysis/generate_all.py
```

### TODO

- Add a simple turn-level simulator: how do frame-level errors translate to interruption rate?
- Add barge-in measurement: overlap duration between user speech and agent audio.
