	<h1>About</h1>
	<p>
		I’m Guy Abi Hanna, a Senior AI Engineer based in Paris. I build low-latency conversational
		systems, real-time voice agents, and the infrastructure that keeps them reliable.
	</p>
	<p>
		My work sits at the intersection of product, systems design, and applied research. I care about
		shipping clear, durable systems that feel fast and human.
