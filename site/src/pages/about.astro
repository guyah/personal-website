<Layout title="About, Guy Abi Hanna" description="Builder across games, IoT, ML, and voice AI in production.">
	<h1>About</h1>

	<p class="lede">
		I'm Guy Abi Hanna, a builder with a wide technical range. I learn by shipping, then I deepen
		by doing the hard parts: performance, reliability, and production reality.
	</p>

	<p>
		I grew up in Lebanon. Right after high school I started coding from scratch. My first real
		entry point was Swift, learned from Simon Allardice on Lynda. It was early Swift, moving fast,
		breaking often, and forcing you to actually understand what you were doing.
	</p>

	<p>
		That turned into 10+ hyper-casual mobile games around the Flappy Bird era. I designed,
		implemented, published, and monetized them with AdMob (banner and interstitial ads). I later
		stopped maintaining those games and over time they were unpublished from the App Store, but the
		lesson stuck: ship, measure, iterate.
	</p>

	<p>
		Since then I've worked across IoT, computer vision, and applied ML, and today I'm a Senior AI
		Engineer at BCG X (formerly Gamma). I spend most of my time bridging the gap between what a
		prototype shows and what production requires.

		<ul>
			<li>Build voice bots and GenAI systems end to end</li>
			<li>Take ideas to production (latency, reliability, evaluation, iteration)</li>
			<li>Onboard teams on new tech and surface the hidden edge cases early</li>
			<li>Find the 80/20: high value, low effort moves that unlock progress</li>
		</ul>
