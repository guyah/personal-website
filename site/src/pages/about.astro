	<h1>About</h1>
	<p class="lede">
		I’m Guy Abi Hanna. I started as a self-taught builder, then expanded into machine learning,
		computer vision, and systems, and today I build voice and GenAI products in production.
	</p>
	<p>
		I grew up in Lebanon. Right after high school I learned an early version of Swift from Simon
		Allardice on Lynda and shipped hyper-casual games to learn fast. That period shaped how I work:
		ship small, measure reality, and iterate.
	</p>
	<p>
		Now I’m a Senior AI Engineer at BCG X. I spend most of my time bridging the gap between what a
		prototype shows and what production requires.
