# personal-website

Private repo for Guy’s personal website.

## Goals (v1)
- Minimal, fast, content-first site (inspired by niels.degran.de + steipete.me)
- Blog + RSS
- Deployed only with explicit Guy “GO” (critical action)

## Structure (planned)
- /site  (frontend)
- /infra (IaC) — optional

## Project tracking
We use a GitHub Project board (Kanban): Inbox / Next / Doing / Blocked / Done.
